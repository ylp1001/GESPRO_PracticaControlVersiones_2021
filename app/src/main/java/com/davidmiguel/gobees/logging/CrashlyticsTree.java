/**
 * Implementation of Timber.Tree which sends exceptions and logs to Crashlytics.
 * Logged messages are associated with the crash data and are visible in the Crashlytics
 * dashboard if you look at the specific crash itself.
 * In addition to writing to the next crash report, it will also write to the LogCat.
 * To make sure that sending crash reports has the smallest impact on your user’s devices,
 * Crashlytics logs have a maximum size of 64 KB. When a log exceeds 64 KB, the earliest
 * logged values will be dropped in order to maintain this threshold.
 * All logged exceptions will appear as “non-fatal” issues in the Fabric dashboard.
 * For any individual app session, only the most recent 8 logged exceptions are stored.
